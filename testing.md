## HTML and CSS Validation

All HTML files were tested using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Template-specific Django tags (`{% %}`, `{{ }}`) were ignored during validation, and all structural HTML errors were corrected.

<details>
<summary><strong>✔ base.html</strong> – Passed with minor template tag warnings</summary>

**Notes:**
- Fixed missing `lang="en"` attribute.
- Ensured `<title>` is correctly placed within `<head>`.
- Stray template tags caused warnings but were not actual HTML issues.

**Status:** ✅ Pass

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✔ post_list.html</strong> – Passed</summary>

**Notes:**

### 🟡 Warning: Empty `<h5>` Heading Elements
- **No fix required.** These were false positives caused by empty template tags like `{{ comment.author }}` when no value was rendered.
- Example:
  ```html
  <h5 class="card-title">{{ comment.author }}</h5>
  ```

### 🔴 Error: `<p>` Inside `<h5>`
> **Error:** Element `<p>` not allowed as a child of element `<h5>` in this context.

#### Cause:
A `<p>` tag (block-level element) was nested inside a heading element, which violates HTML rules — only phrasing content is allowed inside headings.

#### Fix Implemented:
Updated this:

```html
<h5>
  Comment title
  <p class="text-muted small mb-1">Posted on 1 May 2025</p>
</h5>
```

To:

```html
<h5>Comment title</h5>
<p class="text-muted small mb-1">Posted on 1 May 2025</p>
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Accessibility Summary

This site was tested using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to help ensure it is usable by as many people as possible, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation.

All critical issues were resolved, including:

- Making sure every image has alt text
- Ensuring that every page has a proper heading structure (with one main heading)
- Removing empty heading tags that were confusing for screen readers
- Adding descriptive link text (like “Read more about this post”) where needed
- Including a hidden heading in the site’s layout to support screen readers
- **Redundant Links**: WAVE flagged multiple links pointing to the same destination within each blog card — for example, both the post title and a "Read more" button linking to the full post. While this is a common and user-friendly design pattern, it was reviewed for accessibility. To reduce potential confusion for screen reader users, one of the duplicate links was removed, leaving a single clear and descriptive link per card.
- **Low Contrast Buttons**: WAVE identified that the original "Edit" and "Delete" comment buttons had low contrast due to Bootstrap's `outline` button styles. These were updated to solid `btn-secondary` and `btn-danger` styles with white text to ensure they are readable and accessible to all users.

Some common blog patterns, like linking both the post title and a “Read more” button to the same page, were kept for usability but reviewed to make sure they didn’t cause confusion.

The site now passes accessibility checks and offers a user-friendly experience across devices and assistive technologies.
